hand-gesture recognition with Matlab

This is the codes of my MSC project, the aim of the project was to design a hand gesture recognition system.
Python, Matlab, C, C++ , anything can be used to design this system, there was no limitations. However, the system should be adjust easily in different occasions.

What i did was using Matlab which is the most familiar to me.
In November 2018, i was travelling in Shenzhen, China. A part of my programme was sold for a Japanese company in China HI-TECH fair. For some reasons, I won't put in this page.(Denosing and Tracking)

There are many methods can be used to recognize. In this place, the methods used were written in comment. No worries for the denosing and tracking part, because i put some other algorithms instead of the losing part in this program. Hopefully they can run without any errors. For the test, 50+ different background were chosen to support, but no test for the reworte part for personal reasons. My apologise.


When you use the system, some settings MUST BE DONE before your start:
1. choose and set cammera.
2. make sure the background environment is as good as possible.
3. adjust threshold to a suitable value.(HSV space in this system)
My test result was 90% in perfect background environment, fps: 120;
                   60% in bad background environment, fps:120;
